    <h1>Backdoor Algorithm Explanations</h1>
    <p>The backdoor criterion is a graphical condition used to identify sets of variables that, when conditioned on, allow for an unbiased estimate of a causal effect. Here are the steps to determine if a set of variables Z satisfies the backdoor criterion for estimating the effect of X on Y:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>No node in Z is a descendant of X.</li>
        <li>Z blocks every path between X and Y that contains an arrow into X.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By satisfying these conditions, we can ensure that we are appropriately adjusting for confounding variables, leading to a valid causal inference.</p>
